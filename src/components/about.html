    <h2>About Hypercube</h2>

    <p>“Hypercube Finance” is a derivative product of the TBCC developers, which is the result of many years<br /> of
        painstaking work of the best experts in artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>The neural network predicts changes in quotations with an accuracy of 70-80% and allows you to determine<br />
        the
        direction of changes in the price of an asset, signaling the appearance of a point of entry into a
        transaction<br />
        or an exit from it. Thus, “Hypercube Finance” allows users to make money on high-frequency trading.
